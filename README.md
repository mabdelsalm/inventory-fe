# Angular Inventory

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5. <br />
This project represents a small inventory connected with REST api application mentioned in `Environment.apiURL`  which allows you to do CRUD operations.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. </br>
This project is connected with [Netlify](https://inventory-web-app.netlify.app/) which means once you commit a change it will be deployed directly as continuous deployment is on.
All you need to do is to change `Environment` variable `apiURL` in order to points to your api application.
